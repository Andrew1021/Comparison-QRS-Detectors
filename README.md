Comparison of QRS Detectors (in Python)
=======
Abstract
-----------
The aim of this project is to empirically compare the Pan-Tompkins, Engelse-Zeelenberg and Christov heart rate detector algorithms. 
And as second task examine why and how noisy ECG signals affect the QRS detection process and how an error correction try to approach this problem.
